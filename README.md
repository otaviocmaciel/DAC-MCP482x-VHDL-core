# DAC-MCP482x-VHDL-core

# Description
This project implements a VHDL core for the MCP482x Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC). The MCP482x is a 12-bit DAC that can be used in various applications where it is necessary to convert digital signals into analog signals. The MCP4xxx DAC family includes various device configurations. Initially, I used the MCP4822. This DAC has a configurable internal reference, which can be either 2.048V or 4.096V. This configuration is done through the SPI packet sent to the DAC.
